        <p1 style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
            i liked how the author focuses on the concepts of care, slowness and transparency while talking about an environment that is not as tactile as the ones that we're used to interact with. carpenter touches on how medium affects the interaction and curiosity that comes with it. webcrafting and webweaving were what came to my mind while reading this article. how people carefully choose the poems, images from different platforms and combine it in a small collection and how people just open hundreds of .html documents just to experiment and try journaling/zining in a web environment. it made me feel not so alone, once i started reading the readings mentioned; made me realize that there were and are still people who won't find conformity in the capitalist-consumerist state of the web.

          <h2><i>&nbsp;around "hello world" by taeyoon choi</i></h2>
            <p1 style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                it felt like a warm and a timeless embrace, taeyoon touched on the importance of metaphors and understanding how we relate to our surroundings. do we belong in cities? are we machines that put smaller machines forward in a matrushka-core city? are we patient when our computers slow down? do we feel for them and their hard work? do cities get mad at us for working slowly? do think of our computers as friends? do we take care of our computers, those little machines that do our work daily and help us preserve our most precious memories?
