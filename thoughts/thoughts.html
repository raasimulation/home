        <h2><i>&nbsp;on "a handmade web" by j.r carpenter</i></h2>
        <p1 style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
            i liked how the author focuses on the concepts of care, slowness and transparency while talking about an environment that is not as tactile as the ones that we're used to interact with. carpenter touches on how medium affects the interaction and curiosity that comes with it. webcrafting and webweaving were what came to my mind while reading this article. how people carefully choose the poems, images from different platforms and combine it in a small collection and how people just open hundreds of .html documents just to experiment and try journaling/zining in a web environment. it made me feel not so alone, once i started reading the readings mentioned; made me realize that there were and are still people who won't find conformity in the capitalist-consumerist state of the web.
